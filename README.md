Allen Institute for Brain Science provides a tremendous amount of public online resources:
    - Released data is available for public use
    - Data analysis and mining are performed after data release
    - Approximately 50,000 visits/month from global users (academia, biotech/pharma, nonprofit, government)
    
The `lecture_notes.ipynb` notebook is mainly taken from the 2018 neurohackademy session, and is an introduction on how to access Allen Brain Observatory data through the Python API.
